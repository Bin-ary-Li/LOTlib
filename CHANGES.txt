May 12 2014:
	- Added support for types (in the semantic/functional sense), that play nicely with nested lambdas
	- Major refactoring of Lexicon, into SimpleLexicon, WeightedLexicon, and Examples/Quantifier/GriceanWeightedLexicon
	- Changed SimpleLexicon to hold Hypotheses for each word, instead of FunctionNodes
	- Addition of a Testing folder
	- Added example on regular expression inference, demonstrating how to add a new type of "eval"
	- Moved vectorized quantifier stuff to a new subfolder, that will have to be brought up to date eventually
	- Changed serialization to allow for serialization of arbitrary things, with lambdas, etc. This uses the "cloud" library instead of pickle
	
May 1 2014:
	- Major change: is_terminal now only checks that the descendants are NOT functionNodes
	- Added lot_iter, which takes a generator and wraps it so that ctrl-c will break 
	- Added magnetism example
	
Jan 28 2014:
	- Many changes to naming:
		lp now posterior_score
		v (function argument in hypothesses) now value
		tweaks to weighted_sample, to remove old style usage
		chanes to p/lp in GrammarRule
		
Dec 14 2013:
	- Major revision breaking backward compatibility -- changes to FunctionNode syntax in PCFGs so it makes more sense. Non-function terminals have None as args; function terminals have []
	- Also changed "PCFG" to "Grammar" since it's not technically a pcfg
	- Changed bv so that they now have a name and a type (if the type is set to [], they are function calls, else they can expand their type below)
	- In doing this, the grammar was changed so that each nonterminal can add at most *one* bound variable (no longer a list). This lets lambda be higher order (but typed)
	- Changed to semantic version numbering, and advanced to version 0.0.1
Dec 12, 2013:
	- Changed the .copy() methods to all use the python standard __copy__. This now correctly is handled throughout inheritance
	- Fixed README.md
	- Removed memoization -- not used anymore (but should be added back in eventually)
	- Removed a bunch of old files
Dec 10, 2013:
	- Changed GaussianLOTHypothesis to require ll_sd in FunctionData, not as an argument to the hypothesis.
Dec 9 2013:
	- Removed crazy function call notation () in bound variables. Now if you want that, you need to call apply (as before)
	- Cleaned up FiniteBestSet a little -- added FiniteBestSet.add and kinder merge
	- Cleaned up Number Search to play nicer with new MPI_map
Dec 2 2013:
	- Added RR example
Sep 23, 2013:
	- Removed parallel MPI functions to a separate library, SimpleMPI. This keeps the core LOTlib code separate, and allows easy use of mapping in other applications

July 28, 2013
	- added NAND Compression example
	- Made FunctionNode.depth() return an int
	- added all_binary_vectors to Miscellaneous
	
April 23, 2013
	- Got rid of the annoying MPI warning for too many calls to MPI_Finalize()
	- Progress bar tweaks
	- made BasicPrimitives.ancestors O(N) instead of O(N^2)
	
April 22, 2013
	- Changed "StandardExpression" to "LOTHypothesis"
	- Made FunctionNodes have a default iterator of subnodes, and removed FunctionNode.all_subnodes()
	- Changed "temperature" in MCMC to apply *only* to the LL, not the prior. This helps keep our PCFGs defined even for higher temperature
	- Created a friendly changelog

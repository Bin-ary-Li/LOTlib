Dec 9 2013:
	- Removed crazy function call notation () in bound variables. Now if you want that, you need to call apply (as before)
	- Cleaned up FiniteBestSet a little -- added FiniteBestSet.add and kinder merge
	- Cleaned up Number Search to play nicer with new MPI_map
Dec 2 2013:
	- Added RR example
Sep 23, 2013:
	- Removed parallel MPI functions to a separate library, SimpleMPI. This keeps the core LOTlib code separate, and allows easy use of mapping in other applications

July 28, 2013
	- added NAND Compression example
	- Made FunctionNode.depth() return an int
	- added all_binary_vectors to Miscellaneous
	
April 23, 2013
	- Got rid of the annoying MPI warning for too many calls to MPI_Finalize()
	- Progress bar tweaks
	- made BasicPrimitives.ancestors O(N) instead of O(N^2)
	
April 22, 2013
	- Changed "StandardExpression" to "LOTHypothesis"
	- Made FunctionNodes have a default iterator of subnodes, and removed FunctionNode.all_subnodes()
	- Changed "temperature" in MCMC to apply *only* to the LL, not the prior. This helps keep our PCFGs defined even for higher temperature
	- Created a friendly changelog

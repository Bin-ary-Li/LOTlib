== LOTlib
========================================================

LOTlib is a python library for programming "language of thought" models. With it, you specify a set of primitives and can model learners who search over compositions of the primitives to express complex concepts. The examples provided all describe a grammar and a probablistic Bayesian model over the expressions generated by that grammar, and using sampling in order to determine likely hypotheses, given some observed data. There are several sampling methods provided, including tree-regeneration metropolis-hastings (from the Rational Rules model of Goodman et al. 2010), and variants that include tempering, tempered transitions, and Gibbs sampling. This library provides basic support for MPI through mpi4py, allowing sampling algorithms to run in parallel on a single computer, or an entire cluster. 

The best way to use this library is to read and modify the examples. 

NOTE: The bound-variable part of PCFGs is not tested or debugged (yet).

This code is based on scheme code by Steve Piantadosi, and was ported to python 2.6 in September 2011. The scheme code is available upon request (piantado@mit.edu).


Required modules: lockfile, pyparsing

========================================================
== REQUIREMENTS
========================================================

lockfile
pyparsing
mpi4py (if using MPI)

========================================================
== INSTALLATION:
========================================================

Put this library somewhere--mine lives in /home/piantado/mit/Libraries/LOTlib/
	
Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to LOTlib/:
	
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/piantado/Desktop/mit/Libraries/LOTlib
	
You can put this into your .bashrc file to make it loaded automatically when you open a terminal. On ubuntu and most linux, this is:
	
	echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/piantado/Desktop/mit/Libraries/LOTlib' >> ~/.bashrc

And you should be ready to use the library

== EXAMPLES:
========================================================

Examples are provided in the "examples" folder. These include simple symbolic regression, the recursive number learning model, a quantifier learning model. The "tests" folder may also be useful, as this runs some simple models to check for, e.g., correct sampling and inference.

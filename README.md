LOTlib
------

LOTlib is a Python 2.x library for programming "language of thought" models. With it, you specify a set of primitives and can model learners who search over compositions of the primitives to express complex concepts. The examples provided all describe a grammar and a probablistic Bayesian model over the expressions generated by that grammar, and using sampling in order to determine likely hypotheses, given some observed data. 

There are several sampling methods provided, including tree-regeneration metropolis-hastings (from the Rational Rules model of Goodman et al. 2010), and variants that include tempering, tempered transitions, and other search algorithms. 

The best way to use this library is to read and modify the examples. On-going development is focused on providing testing, documentation, and evaluation suites. 

This library provides support for MPI through SimpleMPI (a wrapper for mpi4py), allowing sampling algorithms to run in parallel on a single computer, or an entire cluster. 

RELEASE NOTES
-------------

The original vesion of LOTlib was based on scheme code (available upon request) and was ported to python 2.x in September 2011. 

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- numpy
- scipy

The following are useful for many algorithms:

- SimpleMPI (if using MPI; requires mpi4py)
- pyparsing (for parsing)
- cachetools (for memoization)

INSTALLATION
------------

Put this library somewhere - e.g. ~/Libraries/LOTlib/
	
Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to LOTlib/:
	
	$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/Libraries/LOTlib
	
You can put this into your .bashrc file to make it loaded automatically when you open a terminal. On ubuntu and most linux, this is:
	
	$ echo 'export PYTHONPATH=\$PYTHONPATH:~/Libraries/LOTlib' >> ~/.bashrc

And you should be ready to use the library via:
	
	import LOTlib
	
EXAMPLES
--------

A good starting place is the FOL folder, which contains a simple example to generate first-order logical expressions. These have simple boolean functions as well as lambda expressions. 

The best reference for learning how to create/modify grammars is Examples.FunctionNodeDemo. It contains all of the syntax for various parts of grammars. 

More examples are provided in the "Examples" folder. These include simple symbolic regression, the recursive number learning model, a quantifier learning model. The "tests" folder may also be useful, as this runs some simple models to check for, e.g., correct sampling and inference. The Number demo has syntax for a number of different sampling and inference schemes included in LOTlib.
